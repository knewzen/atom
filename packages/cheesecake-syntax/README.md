# cheesecake-syntax theme

Syntax theme that is dark and easy on the eyes. Designed for long coding sprints with no distractions, unless the name of the theme makes you grab a cheesecake. By @evalir.io

# Development

This is a work in progress, which means the theme can and will change over time. The theme currently works best with HTML/CSS/JS, C++ and the Arduino dialect of C++. If you find any language that makes the theme look ugly, do send a photo and tell me so I can work on it. Also, feel free to fork the theme and make your own variant, I'd be honored!

# Installation
- Launch Atom, go to 'Settings'
- Select the 'install' tab
- Select 'themes' and look for 'cheesecake'
- Install and Voila! You have the Cheesecake syntax theme.
